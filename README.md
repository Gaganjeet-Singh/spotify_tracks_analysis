🎵 Spotify Tracks Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Spotify tracks. The goal of this project is to better understand the characteristics of songs using the Spotify dataset and visualize how various audio features change across time, genres, and popularity levels.

Musical Attributes: Tempo, key, mode, loudness, duration
Audio Features: Danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness

📊 Visualizations

The notebook (main.ipynb) includes various plots and charts such as:
Average tempo trends over time
Energy and valence changes across years
Distribution of musical features (e.g., loudness, danceability)
Genre-based comparisons

Python
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib – Visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment
